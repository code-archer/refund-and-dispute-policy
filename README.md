## Code Archer LLC Refund and Dispute Resolution Policy

This policy outlines the process for refunds and dispute resolution between Code Archer LLC ("Company") and its clients ("Client"). We are committed to resolving issues fairly and efficiently.

**1. Refunds:**

*   Specific refund policies for individual products or services will be outlined in the applicable contract for services or purchase agreement.
*   Generally, refund requests must be submitted within **30** days of purchase/service delivery and must clearly state the reason for the request.
*   The Company reserves the right to deny refund requests that do not meet the specified criteria.

**2. Dispute Resolution:**

We encourage open communication and strive to resolve disputes amicably. The following process will be followed:

**a. Direct Negotiation:**

*   The Client must first notify the Company of any dispute in writing, providing a detailed description of the issue and the desired resolution.
*   The Company will make reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute through direct communication with the Client within **14** business days.

**b. Mediation (Optional):**

*   If direct negotiation is unsuccessful, either party may propose mediation.
*   Mediation will be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon neutral mediator in **Cheyenne, Wyoming** or remotely.
*   The costs of mediation will be shared equally by both parties.

**c. Binding Arbitration:**

*   If mediation (if pursued) is unsuccessful, or if either party chooses not to pursue mediation, any unresolved dispute arising out of or relating to a service or purchase agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. You can find these rules at https://www.adr.org/Rules.
*   The arbitration shall take place in **Cheyenne, Wyoming** or remotely, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
*   The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedies available in a court of law.
*   The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**d. Governing Law and Venue:**

*   This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law.
*   To the extent any court action is permitted under this agreement (e.g., to enforce an arbitration award), the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in **Laramie County, Wyoming**.

**3. Attorney's Fees:**

In any arbitration or litigation arising out of or related to this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

**4. Exceptions:**
